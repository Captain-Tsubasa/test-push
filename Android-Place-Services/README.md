Google Places API for Android Samples
===================================

Samples that use the [Google Places API for Android](https://developers.google.com/places/android/).

This repo contains the following samples:

1. [PlacePicker](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-places/tree/master/PlacePicker): 
Uses the [PlacePicker widget](https://developers.google.com/places/android/placepicker)
and the [Geo Data API](https://developers.google.com/places/android/place-details)
to select a place and retrieve its details.
2. [PlaceComplete](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-places/tree/master/PlaceComplete):
Implements an AutoCompleteTextView backed by the
[Place Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/places/android/autocomplete).

Note that each folder contains a distinct sample and must be imported separately.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v21
- Android Build Tools v21.1.1
- Android Support Repository

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. 

First download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
snapshot. (See the options on the right hand side.)

In Android Studio, use the "Import non-Android Studio project" or 
"Import Project" option. Next select one of the sample directories
("PlacePicker" or "PlaceComplete").  If prompted for a gradle configuration
accept the default settings. 

Alternatively use the "gradlew build" command to build the project directly.

Don't forget to add your API key to the AndroidManifest.xml.
